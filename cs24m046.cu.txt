\begin{theorem}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be a connected graph, and let $F \subseteq E(G)$ be a subset of edges such that:
\[
F \not\subseteq B(G),
\]
where $B(G)$ denotes the set of bridges (cut-edges) in $G$. Then there exists a cycle $C$ in $G$ such that:
\[
|C \cap F| \text{ is odd}.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Since $F$ is not a cut, removing the edges in $F$ does not disconnect $G$. Define the graph:
\[
H = (V, E \setminus F).
\]
Since $H$ remains connected, it contains a spanning tree $T$. A spanning tree has exactly $|V| - 1$ edges and spans all vertices of $G$. Since $F$ does not disconnect $G$, each edge in $F$ must connect vertices that remain in the same component of $H$.

For each edge $e = (u, v) \in F$, there exists a unique path $P_{uv}$ in $T$ such that:
\[
C_e = P_{uv} \cup \{e\}
\]
is a cycle in $G$.

The set of all cycles in $G$ forms a vector space over $\mathbb{Z}_2$, called the \textit{cycle space} $Z(G)$, which is given by:
\[
Z(G) = \{ C \subseteq E(G) \mid C \text{ is a cycle in } G \}.
\]

This space has a basis consisting of the fundamental cycles $\{C_e \mid e \in F\}$, and every cycle in $G$ is a \textit{linear combination (modulo 2)} of these fundamental cycles.

Since $F$ is not a cut, the edges in $F$ form a linearly dependent set in the cycle space. This implies that there exists a nontrivial cycle $C$ that is a sum of fundamental cycles:
\[
C = \sum_{e \in F} C_e \quad (\text{mod } 2).
\]

By properties of linear algebra over $\mathbb{Z}_2$, at least one such cycle must contain an \textit{odd} number of edges from $F$, meaning:
\[
|C \cap F| \text{ is odd}.
\]

Thus, the proof is complete.
\end{proof}
